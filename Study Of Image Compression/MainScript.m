%In this is Script following operations are done on a sample Image
% 1) Display original Image
% 2) Treat each bit of the 8 bit grayscale image as separate image plane 
%    and plot each bit plane as separate 8 images.
% 3) Finally combine all the bit image planes EXCEPT the LSB Image plane,
%    and display the resultant image.
% 4) Observe the effect of compression i.e removal of the LSB plane on the
%   memory size and the quality of image w.r.t original.
